## Network Segmentation Overview

This homelab is designed to simulate a segmented homelab network with controlled trust boundaries and attack paths.

The lab is divided into three security zones:

1. Dyson Swarm (Server Zone)
2. Sentinels (Attacker Zone)
3. Contaminated Zone (Vulnerable Systems)
